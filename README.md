### Make sure that your postgres server has been started (if entering psql in your terminal opens up a postgres shell, then you're good to go), and then create the your-db-name database:

* `createdb your-db-name`

### MacOS/Linux

* `npm install`
* `npm start`
* Open another terminal window; from there, `npm run seed` to seed the database
